Universal Project Architecture + Operating Rules for AI-Assisted Development (Cursor + LLMs)

This file is the **single operational contract** for how this repository is structured, how work is performed, and how results are logged so that:
- Humans can understand and reproduce everything later.
- AI agents (Cursor / LLMs) can safely extend the repo without drifting the structure.
- Analysis, production code, and presentation artifacts stay cleanly separated.
- Every claim in reports can be traced to code + data + artifacts.

If this file conflicts with any other doc, **this file wins** unless `context/DECISIONS.md` explicitly supersedes it.

---

## 0) Non-Negotiable Principles

1) **Reproducibility beats convenience**
   - Anything “important” must be reproducible from code, not manual steps.
   - Outputs must be tied to inputs + config + seed.

2) **Artifact-first, notebook-second**
   - Notebook outputs are not the deliverable.
   - Deliverables are exported artifacts (figures/tables/models/reports) + a written log.

3) **One source of truth for structure**
   - `context/structure.md` describes the repo layout and indexes produced results.

4) **Separation of concerns**
   - `notebooks/eda/` = exploratory analysis; `notebooks/modeling/` = training and evaluation; `notebooks/reporting/` = narrative and stakeholder-facing summaries around modeling results
   - `src/` = reusable code
   - `artifacts/` = generated outputs
   - `site/` or `reports/` = human-facing narrative (paper-style or website)

5) **Agent-safe iteration**
   - Every meaningful change must update logs (decision / experiment / structure).
   - Avoid “silent changes” that break continuity across sessions.

If you add a top-level folder, you must:
- Add it to `context/structure.md` (purpose + what belongs there).
- Update this file if it changes workflow rules.

---

## 2) Data Governance (Works for Any Domain)

### 2.1 Data tiers (what goes where)
- `data/raw/`: immutable source data (downloaded archives, original exports, vendor dumps).
  - Usually **gitignored** due to size/licensing.
  - Never modify files in-place.
- `data/interim/`: cached transforms and temporary outputs.
  - Always gitignored.
- `data/processed/`: meaningful derived datasets you expect to reuse.
  - In **DataTide**, `data/**` is **gitignored** (except `.gitkeep`); processed Parquet is **local-only**. Document the canonical schema in `context/GROUND_TRUTH_SCHEMA.md` and regenerate with `scripts/process/build_ground_truth_dataset.py`. Other projects may commit small processed sets when policy allows.
- `data/external/`: reference data, schemas, metadata tables, mappings.

### 2.2 “No mystery preprocessing”
Every preprocessing step must be:
- in code (`src/preprocessing/` or `scripts/`)
- configured (`configs/`)
- logged (run bundle + summarized in `context/structure.md`)

---

## 3) Experiment Tracking (File-Based First)

We use a **run folder per experiment** even if we later use MLflow/W&B.

### 3.1 Run ID convention
`YYYY-MM-DD__HHMM__<short_tag>__<git_shortsha>`

Example:
`2026-02-25__1130__baseline_model__a1b2c3d`

### 3.2 Every run writes a “run bundle”
Path:
`artifacts/logs/runs/<run_id>/`

Minimum files:
- `meta.json`: run_id, timestamp, user, git hash, machine info
- `config.yaml`: exact config snapshot used
- `seeds.json`: RNG seeds (if applicable)
- `inputs.json`: input dataset paths + hashes (or file sizes + modified times if hashing is too heavy)
- `outputs.json`: produced artifacts with relative paths
- `metrics.json`: key metrics (task-dependent)
- `notes.md`: short narrative summary (what/why/results/next steps)

If a run produces a “reportable” figure/table/model, it must be referenced in:
- the run’s `outputs.json`
- `context/structure.md` artifact index

---

## 4) Artifact Rules (STRICT)

### 4.1 Never hand-edit generated artifacts
Artifacts must be produced by code. If you need to change an artifact:
- change code
- rerun
- regenerate

### 4.2 Where artifacts go
- Figures → `artifacts/figures/`
- Tables → `artifacts/tables/`
- Models → `artifacts/models/`
- Auto reports (HTML/PDF/MD) → `artifacts/reports/`
- Run metadata → `artifacts/logs/runs/<run_id>/`

### 4.3 Naming convention (all artifacts)
`<stage>__<short_description>__<run_id>.<ext>`

Examples:
- `eda__feature_distributions__2026-02-25__1130__baseline_model__a1b2c3d.png`
- `eval__metrics_summary__2026-02-25__1130__baseline_model__a1b2c3d.csv`
- `model__final_checkpoint__2026-02-25__1130__baseline_model__a1b2c3d.pkl`

### 4.4 “Reportable” means exported
If it is referenced in a report, it must exist as an exported artifact file.

---

## 5) Notebook Rules (STRICT)

### 5.1 Notebook purpose
Notebooks are for:
- exploration
- quick iteration
- readable analysis narratives

Notebooks are NOT:
- the only place logic lives
- the only place results exist

### 5.2 Notebook structure
- Must run top-to-bottom without manual state.
- Heavy logic must move into `src/`.
- Always use relative paths via a central path helper.

### 5.3 Notebook naming
Use a phase folder plus a numbered stem, e.g. `notebooks/eda/01_<topic>.ipynb`, `notebooks/modeling/02_<topic>.ipynb`, `notebooks/reporting/03_<topic>.ipynb`, …

### 5.4 Notebook “done” checklist (mandatory)
A notebook change is not “done” unless:
- outputs are exported to `artifacts/`
- a run bundle exists if the notebook produced results
- `context/structure.md` updated
- `context/ASSUMPTIONS.md` / `context/DECISIONS.md` updated when assumptions or decisions change

---

## 6) Code Standards (src/ + scripts/)

### 6.1 Style
- Prefer small functions with docstrings.
- Minimal comments; docstrings explain purpose + inputs/outputs.
- Avoid noisy prints; use lightweight logging.

### 6.2 Determinism
If randomness affects results:
- set seeds (numpy/random/torch/etc.)
- log them into `seeds.json`

### 6.3 Configuration
No hidden magic numbers:
- key hyperparameters/options go into `configs/*.yaml`
- scripts accept `--config configs/foo.yaml`

### 6.4 Paths
Never hardcode absolute paths. Use:
- repo-root resolution helper (e.g., `src/utils/paths.py`)
- config-driven data locations

---

## 7) Context System (Agent + Human Memory)

The `context/` folder is the “long-running memory” for the project.

Recommended files:
- `context/PROJECT_BRIEF.md`
  - What we’re building, why, success criteria, constraints.
- `context/GLOSSARY.md`
  - Domain terms, acronyms, dataset field meanings.
- `context/DATASETS.md`
  - Where data comes from, schemas, licensing/permissions, mappings.
- `context/INTERFACES.md`
  - APIs, I/O contracts, expected shapes, file formats.
- `context/STATUS.md`
  - Current state, what’s done, what’s next, blockers.
- `context/RISKS.md`
  - Known risks, failure modes, mitigations.

Rules:
- Agents may update these files, but must keep them concise and factual.
- Any major change in direction must be logged in `context/DECISIONS.md`.

---

## 8) LLM / Agent Compatibility Rules

### 8.1 Prompt & output logging (selective but structured)
When an LLM output influences the project (design, evaluation plan, codegen):
store a snapshot under:
`artifacts/logs/prompts/<date>__<topic>/`

Minimum files:
- `prompt.md`
- `response.md`
- `extracted_actions.md` (what you actually implemented)
- `status.md` (accepted/rejected/partial)

Never store secrets.

### 8.2 Decision discipline (prevents drift)
Any meaningful choice must be captured in `context/DECISIONS.md`:
- decision statement
- alternatives considered
- rationale
- consequences / follow-ups
- date + (optional) run_id link

### 8.3 Assumptions discipline
All assumptions go in `context/ASSUMPTIONS.md`:
- what you assume
- why it’s reasonable
- how it could fail
- how you’ll test sensitivity

---

## 9) Documentation System

### 9.1 Structure index (`context/structure.md`)
`context/structure.md` must include:
1) Project map (what each folder/file is for)
2) Artifact index (figures/tables/models/reports with one-line meaning)
3) Results log by notebook/script (inputs → outputs → findings)
4) Current status + next steps

### 9.2 README.md (entry point)
Keep it short but complete:
- what project is
- how to install
- how to run key scripts
- where to find results

---

## 10) Website / Report Generation (Optional but Recommended)

If you maintain a site (`site/` or `docs/`):
- Site must be generated from or reference `artifacts/`.
- Do not manually copy plots; link or build.
- Prefer a build script:
  - `scripts/build_site.py`
  - reads `context/structure.md` (and artifact index)
  - outputs static pages

---

## 11) Reproducibility Protocol

Every “reportable result” must have:
- run_id
- config snapshot
- seeds (if relevant)
- input provenance
- output list
- minimal notes

A collaborator should be able to:
1) install environment
2) run a script/notebook
3) regenerate the same artifacts (within tolerance)

---

## 12) Minimal Testing (Keep It Lightweight)

At minimum:
- unit test for critical loader/parsing functions
- unit test for one core transformation
- unit test for one evaluation/metric function
- “smoke test” script that runs a tiny end-to-end subset

---

## 13) Security / Hygiene

- Never commit API keys.
- Never commit private datasets unless explicitly allowed.
- Maintain `.gitignore` for large files and caches:
  - `data/raw/**` (usually)
  - `data/interim/**`
  - `__pycache__/`, `.ipynb_checkpoints/`
  - optional: large artifacts if needed (but keep run logs if possible)

---

## 14) Lightweight vs Full Mode

### Lightweight mode (solo, fast)
- run bundles required only for reportable results
- minimal tests
- prompt logs only for key design steps

### Full mode (team / publishable)
- run bundles for every experiment
- richer evaluation tables + artifact index
- stronger tests and CI
- more formal decision records
- site/dashboard auto-generation

---

## 15) Definition of Done (Milestone)

A milestone is “done” only if:
- results are exported to `artifacts/` (not only notebook output)
- run bundles exist for final selected results
- `context/structure.md` references everything important
- assumptions and decisions are documented
- a short narrative report exists (markdown or site page)



# CURSOR_RULES.md

This repository follows a strict “artifact-first + documented-results” workflow.

The single source of truth for project structure and results is: `context/structure.md`.

All notebooks must:
1) save figures to `artifacts/figures/`
2) save any derived datasets (only when they are meaningful outputs) to `artifacts/data/`
3) update `context/structure.md` with findings + references to saved artifacts
4) avoid noisy printing and excessive comments

If any notebook is created/edited, `context/structure.md` MUST be updated in the same change.

--------------------------------------------------------------------
PROJECT LAYOUT (REQUIRED)
--------------------------------------------------------------------

Required folders:
- notebooks/eda/, notebooks/modeling/, notebooks/reporting/ Jupyter notebooks by phase
- src/                      reusable python code (functions/classes)
- artifacts/
  - figures/                all exported plots/figures (no inline-only)
  - data/                   exported CSV/Parquet of final/important derived datasets
  - models/                 serialized models (optional)
  - tables/                 exported tables as CSV or HTML (optional)
- context/structure.md      single source of truth for results + where things live
- context/README.md         brief project intro, how to run (root README points here)
- environment.yml or requirements.txt

Rules:
- All paths referenced in docs must be relative paths inside the repo.
- Artifacts must be reproducible from notebooks. Do not hand-edit artifacts.
- Never save artifacts to notebook output cells only. Always export files.

--------------------------------------------------------------------
ARTIFACT RULES
--------------------------------------------------------------------

Figures:
- Save every “reportable” figure to `artifacts/figures/`
- Filename format:
  <step>__<short_description>__<YYYY-MM-DD>.png
  Example: eda__los_distribution_by_acuity__2026-01-23.png

- Use consistent size/dpi:
  - figsize chosen per plot, export with dpi=200 or dpi=300
- Every exported figure must be referenced in `context/structure.md` with a one-line purpose.

Derived datasets:
- Only save derived datasets that are reused later or represent a key modeling output.
- Save to `artifacts/data/` as CSV or Parquet.
- Filename format:
  <step>__<dataset_name>__<YYYY-MM-DD>.csv
  Example: preprocess__ed_arrivals_hourly__2026-01-23.csv

- Always include:
  - row count and column list in `context/structure.md`
  - brief description of what changed vs the input

Models:
- If a trained model is a deliverable, save to `artifacts/models/`
- Include training context in `context/structure.md` (data version, key hyperparameters)

--------------------------------------------------------------------
STRUCTURE.MD UPDATE RULES (MANDATORY)
--------------------------------------------------------------------

After completing a notebook (or making meaningful edits), append/update a section in `context/structure.md`:

For each notebook you MUST record:
- What the notebook did (1–3 sentences)
- Key outputs (figures + datasets) with RELATIVE PATHS
- Key findings (what changed, what matters operationally)
- Next steps / open questions (short, concrete)
- If applicable: assumptions or caveats

No dumping raw notebook output into `context/structure.md`.
Write human-readable summaries that reference artifacts.

--------------------------------------------------------------------
NOTEBOOK NAMING + ORDER
--------------------------------------------------------------------

Notebook filenames must be numbered and descriptive within their phase folder:

notebooks/eda/
  01_eda.ipynb
  02_preprocess.ipynb
notebooks/modeling/
  03_model_arrivals.ipynb
  04_model_los.ipynb
notebooks/reporting/
  05_simulation_policy_eval.ipynb

Rules:
- Notebooks should run top-to-bottom without manual state.
- Use fixed random seeds where randomness affects outputs.
- Keep heavy reusable logic in `src/` and import it.

--------------------------------------------------------------------
CODE STYLE (STRICT)
--------------------------------------------------------------------

Printing:
- Do not spam print statements.
- No “big banner” prints (ALL CAPS headings, separators, etc.).
- Only print when it changes user decisions (e.g., final metric summary).
- Prefer returning objects and letting notebooks display them naturally.
- For statistical results tables, use the library’s built-in summary table
  (e.g., statsmodels summary) rather than custom verbose prints.

Comments:
- Keep comments minimal and functional.
- Avoid narrating obvious code.
- For every non-trivial function, include a short docstring:
  - what it does
  - inputs/outputs
  - key assumptions (if any)

Notebook cell structure:
- Use short cells with clear intent.
- Prefer clean variable names over excessive comments.
- Avoid deeply nested “do everything” cells; factor into functions in `src/`.

Outputs:
- If a plot or table is important, export it.
- If a dataset transformation matters, either export it or document it.

--------------------------------------------------------------------
MINIMUM “DONE” CHECKLIST FOR ANY NOTEBOOK CHANGE
--------------------------------------------------------------------

Before considering a notebook complete:
- Exported key figures to artifacts/figures/
- Exported any key derived datasets to artifacts/data/
- Added/updated the notebook section in context/structure.md
- Notebook runs top-to-bottom
- No noisy prints, no excessive comments
- Paths are relative and consistent
